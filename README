                   x2vnc - A dual-screen hack
          Written by Fredrik Hübinette <hubbe@hubbe.net>
         Based on ideas from x2x and code from vncviewer.

          Thanks to Grant McDorman and Brad Fitzpatrick
            for helping me make this program better.


This program merges the capabilities of x2x and vncviewer.
It will allow a machine with an X display and a machine with
a VNC server running on it's main screen to act as if they
were two displays connected to one machine. When you move
your mouse pointer off the screen in a direction of your
choosing, the pointer will appear on the other screen instead.

There are now two ways to compile x2vnc:

  1) run './configure', then 'make'
  2) edit Imakefile, run 'xmkmf', then 'make'

After compiling, you should su to root and type 'make install'.

The first way is recommended since it will automatically detect
what X11 extensions you have available on your system. For x2vnc
to function properly it is highly recommended that you have the
development packages for the following X11 extensions installed:

     Xinerama   MIT-Screensaver  RANDR and XFree86-DGA

Depending on what distribution you use, you will need to install
different packages:

Ubuntu/hoary:
  apt-get install x-dev libxinerama-dev libxss-dev
  apt-get install libxrandr-dev libxxf86dga-dev 

Debian/stable:
  apt-get install x-dev xlibs-static-dev libxrandr-dev

Debian/unstable:
  apt-get install x11proto-core-dev 
  apt-get install x11proto-xf86dga-dev x11proto-scrnsaver-dev 
  apt-get install libxrandr-dev libxrandr-dev

Fedora 5:
  yum install xorg-x11-proto-devel

Fedora 2-4:
  yum install xorg-x11-devel
