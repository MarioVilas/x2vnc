	* Changes from 1.5.1
	* Added some patches from Grant McDorman to allow proper
	  cut'n'paste between x2vnc and Konsole/gnome-terminal.
	* Honor $DESTDIR to make packaging easier.
        * Added a workaround to make cut'n'paste work better with
	  old VNC servers.
	* Since all new VNC servers already support wheel emulation
	  themseleves, x2vnc doesn't translate wheel events to arrow
	  up/down anymore unless -wheelhack is specified.
	* Added -navhack which is similar to -wheelhack, except it
	  translates button 6 & 7 to Alt+Left/Right.
	* Added -debug to debug key events
	* Allow -edgewidth 0 to turn off edge-flipping

	* Changes from version 1.4
	* Now traps grabkey errors, no more X errors.
	* Xinerama support, allows x2vnc to work
	  sanely on multi-head X displays.
	* If stdin is not a tty, read password with
	  fgets() instead of getpass(). This allows
	  scripts to feed in the password.
	* New arguments -noblank and -lockdelay allows you
	  to keep screen savers from activating while using
	  your computers.

	* Included tkx2vnc, written by David Noble
	* x.c (CreateXWindow): move remote cursor to resting place
	  immediately when connecting to confuse the user less.

2001-11-17  Fredrik Hubinette  <hubbe@cytocin.hubbe.net>

	* changes from version 1.2
	* Fixed cut'n'paste to work with XA_PRIMARY
	* Reversed mouse wheel direction (-reversewheel will get
	  old behavior)
	* Added an autoconf script for easier compilation on 
	  systems where xmkmf has not been configured properly.
	* Fixed -edgewidth to affect mouse pointer returns as well,
	  should fix some problems on Digital Unix.

2000-02-04  Fredrik Hubinette  <hubbe@adenin.hubbe.net>

	* changes from version 1.0:
	* SHIFT-TAB should now work
	* Should now work with xlock and other evil X programs.
	* new option -edgewidth should make it work on
	  Digital Unix X servers.
	* When mouse leaves Win32 machine, it parks the mouse pointer
	  on that machine in a place where you can hardly see it.
	* Applied a patch from Grant McDorman that should make x2vnc
	  work with multiple-screen X servers.
	* Fixed a bug which made x2vnc not work with certain window
	  managers. (Like enlightenment) Thanks to Brad Fitzpatrick for
	  helping me with this one.
	* "xmkmf ; make" should now work.
