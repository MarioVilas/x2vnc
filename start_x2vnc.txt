On computer that you want share the mouse and keyboard but not the screen run [1], this computer only needs sshd on port 22 opened and running, let supose this computer have the 192.168.1.3 ip address.
On main computer you may run [2] where 192.168.1.3 is the ip or the hostname where want have an virtual mouse and keyboard
[3] when you also want share the screen but in this case I use vncviewer [4]
Only TigerVNC have the option "-via gateway" which tunneled communications via ssh.

After we may add option -north, -south, -east, -west, determine which edge leads to the other screen.
and to find more options: man x2vnc
